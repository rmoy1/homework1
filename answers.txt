What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

The difference between a merge and a rebase is that merge involves combining two branches into a single one and records this. In contrast, rebase updates a branch with the commits of another branch and does not record that there were multiple commits. Rebase updates the beginning of a branch to a commit.
